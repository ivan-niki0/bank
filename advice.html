									<p>For Graduates, Interns and Industrial Placements, the application process is the
										same. Here’s how it works:</p>
									<p> </p>
									<h2>Application process – the first stage</h2>
									<h3>Application Form</h3>
									<p>This is your first step, and it starts with a short registration section. This
										will make sure you’re eligible for the programme you’re applying for, and it
										could save you a lot of time.</p>
									<p>You’ll be able to tell us about your education and work experience, as well as
										rate your preference for the different streams we offer. Take a look at the
										‘Graduate Development Programme’ page for more guidance on these. Choosing a
										stream now won’t limit your options later on – it just gives us an idea of the
										areas you’re interested in.</p>
									<p>Please ensure you’ve read the application criteria under ‘Our Programmes’ before
										applying. You’ll be assessed based on your year of study and, if you join as an
										intern or Industrial Placement student, you might even get to convert to the
										Graduate Programme or further internships.</p>
									<p>A note for international applicants: To convert your international qualifications
										into UCAS points for our application form, please use this <a href="">online
											tool</a>. When submitting your application please summarise your
										qualifications in the free form text box at the end of the application form.</p>
									<p> </p>
									<h3>Situational Judgement Test (SJT)</h3>
									<p>After registration, you’ll be sent a link to the SJT. This will present you with
										scenarios like those you’d encounter if you worked here. Each time, you’ll be
										offered a range of potential responses. There are no correct responses to these
										scenarios. Just go with the one you feel is right.</p>
									<p> </p>
									<h3>Online Tests</h3>
									<p>Following the application closing date, successful candidates will be invited to
										complete an online analytical test. This is scenario-based and will assess both
										your analytical and reasoning skills. You cannot practise for this test, but
										make sure you are in a quiet room while completing it. This will allow you to
										give the test your full concentration for the 20 minutes it takes to complete.
									</p>
									<p>Ahead of Assessment Centres, you’ll also be sent a link to the online numerical
										reasoning test, where you’ll also complete a role profile. Neither of these
										tests are used to sift out candidates, but are to assess your skillset against
										your area preferences, and to match you to the stream best suited to you.</p>
									<p> </p>
									<h3>Video Interview</h3>
									<p>You’ll then be asked to answer five questions using our video interview portal.
										We’ll need you to answer all five, so be sure to use the top tips on the portal
										to help you prepare. We’ll be looking at your reasons for applying to the Bank
										and your knowledge of what we do, but we’ll also be interested in understanding
										more about you as a person.</p>
									<p> </p>
								</div>
								<div class="last column">
									<div class="secondary-content">
										<h2><span>Application process – the second stage</span></h2>
										<p>After each stage, we‘ll let you know the outcome of your application. This
											will usually be two weeks after the application deadline for the programme
											you applied for.</p>
										<p>If you’re successful, you’ll move onto the second and final stage – an
											assessment centre at our London office. We run a number of these for our
											different programmes.</p>
										<h2><span>Assessment Centres</span></h2>
										<h3>Industrial Placements</h3>
										<p>These assessment centres run between November and January. You’ll take part
											in an interview with two assessors, and group exercises. We’ll aim to inform
											you about the outcome of your application within three days of the last
											assessment centre. <span>Please note that roles for our Industrial
												Placements are filled on an ongoing basis.</span></p>
										<p> </p>
										<h3>Graduate Development Programme</h3>
										<p>The assessment centres for our Graduates take place between December and
											January. They are skills focused, and consist of an interview and group
											exercises.</p>
										<p>When we invite you to the assessment centre, we’ll let you know which areas
											of the Bank are interested in meeting you. This will allow you to research
											these areas ahead of the day. We’ll aim to inform you about the outcome of
											your application within three days of the last assessment centre.</p>
										<p> </p>
										<h3>Internship Programmes</h3>
										<p>The assessment centres for our Internship Programmes vary depending on your
											year of study – but all will take place between January and March. They all
											include an interview and group exercises, in line with Graduate assessment
											centres. This is so that we can offer high performers the chance to convert
											to the Graduate Programme or further Internships.</p>
										<p> </p>
										<h3>Multiple Applications</h3>
										<p>Unfortunately, we are not looking for more than one application per student.
											Our programmes are focused on students at different points in their academic
											life, so to that end, your first application will be accepted and any
											duplicates will be rejected.</p>
										<p>If you feel you have special circumstances, or if you have any further
											queries regarding the application process, please contact <a
												href="">BankofEngland@penna.com</a></p>
