<h2 class="NoSpacing1">First Year Internship</h2>
<p>Our new First Year Internship scheme is designed for undergraduate students in their first year interested in finding more about the Bank. These internships run for six weeks giving you the opportunity to support a team on a specific project across all areas of the Bank, from procurement or HR to monetary policy and banking supervision. During this time, you’ll be paid a salary of £60 per day. </p>
<p>You will experience excellent development opportunities – from a comprehensive induction to the Bank, through to a range of talks and networking events. If your performance during the six weeks is considered to be outstanding, you will be given the opportunity to be assessed for a Penultimate Year Internship.</p>
