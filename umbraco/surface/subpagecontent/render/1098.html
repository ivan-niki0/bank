</ul>
<div>Our graduate programme offers the chance to develop a career at the heart of the UK economy. But it's not all about economics. Our programme is open to applicants from all disciplines, and has a real focus on personal development.</div>
<p class="NoSpacing1">The new, more transparent ways of working that are so intrinsic to ‘One Bank’ will give you access to more of our leading experts than ever before as well as enabling you to build a holistic view of our organisation. So you'll have all the support and opportunity you need to unlock your full potential.</p>
<h2 class="NoSpacing1">What you'll be doing                 </h2>
<p class="NoSpacing1">Entering a dynamic, challenging and genuinely supportive environment, you'll be involved in work that has a significant impact – not only on the Bank, but on the wider economy too.</p>
<p class="NoSpacing1">Our graduate programme immerses you in important work across our business areas. At the forefront of analytic excellence and research, you'll gather critical information, analyse, report and take part in meetings with a range of colleagues and stakeholders. This will allow you to gain the experience and develop the skills you'll need to become an expert analyst here. </p>
<h2 class="NoSpacing1">Careers at the Bank</h2>
<p>We’re looking for graduates who have achieved, or expect to achieve, a 2:1, with at least 300 UCAS points from three A-levels or equivalent (excluding General Studies). We also look for people who are about to graduate or have graduated in the last two years.</p>
<p>The reason we are looking to hire people with two year’s work experience or less is because our graduate development programme is created to support and develop grads at the beginning of their careers with a mixture of business and technical skills sessions.</p>
<p>If you are interested in working at the Bank of England and have more than two year’s work experience, please take a look at our experienced hire roles on our <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/careers/Pages/default.aspx">careers website.</a></p>

			    <h2 class="NoSpacing1">Who we're looking for</h2>
<p class="NoSpacing1">You’ll need to be a confident team-player with strong analytical skills, including the ability to work with tools and data sources, and to learn new things quickly. You must be comfortable setting your own targets, meeting tight deadlines and working under your own initiative, ready to tackle the most challenging and relevant issues head on.</p>
<p class="NoSpacing1">And, most obviously, we’re looking for those who are really motivated to join the Bank, know what we do and share the sense of our One Bank Mission.</p>
