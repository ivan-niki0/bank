<p class="normal">If you’re due to finish school, university is far from your only option. Take our Future Capability Programme, for example. We designed it to help talented young people get started in their careers, and it could see you grow in a number of key roles.</p>
<h2>Opportunities </h2>
<p>Joining a close-knit peer group, you’ll start the programme with formal introductions to the various areas of the Bank and training sessions on essential skills. You’ll have a full induction to the Bank on joining, and will get the opportunity to find out more about the vast and varied array of work that we undertake here every day.</p>
<p>Everyone who joins the programme will complete a Business Administration Apprenticeship, while being supported by their team as they carry out their role. Complete the programme, and you’ll have opportunities to continue formal study. Your options will include sponsored undergraduate degrees or external qualifications.</p>
<p class="normal">When you apply, you’ll be considered for one of the following areas: </p>
<h3>Operations</h3>
<p>On this stream, you’ll get hands-on experience of what it takes to keep the UK economy moving. You could work in teams including those that look after the management of the Bank of England’s relationship with BACS and the Cheque & Credit Clearing Company, or you could be looking at the management of our external suppliers. Whichever team you join, you’ll gain a wealth of knowledge about what makes banking work.</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>The world is becoming increasingly interconnected, and technology is playing an ever increasing role in the running of global business. We can put you right at the cutting edge of these developments - particularly in terms of cyber security and the digital transfer of money. As you’d expect, working here would give you exposure to experts in the field and provide opportunities ranging from customer service management to highly innovative cyber-security projects.</p>
<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>Without the data that our statistics teams provide, we wouldn’t be able to properly monitor, respond to or anticipate changes in the UK economy. Whichever team you join, you’ll get involved in research that you do here could inform UK economic policy and have real impact on the lives of all of the people of the UK. You’ll hone your analytical capabilities, and you’ll develop in depth knowledge and understanding of all aspects of the economy.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to state a preference for one of these three streams during the application process. We will evaluate you throughout the process to determine the stream which is the best fit for you.</p>

			    <h2><span>Who we're looking for</span></h2>
<p>We want people who are eager to learn and serious about building a career at the heart of the UK economy. You’ll also need to know what we do, share our purpose, and be genuinely motivated to join the Bank of England.</p>
<p>In terms of grades, we’ll be looking for a minimum of five GCSEs at C and above, including English and Maths, and at least 180 UCAS points (either passed or predicted) from up to three A Levels or equivalent.</p>
<p>We are committed to nurturing a diverse and inclusive workforce, so we welcome applications from candidates with all backgrounds.</p>
<h2><span>Application advice</span></h2>
<p>We know that application processes can be a little daunting at first, and we want to make sure you’re ready to perform to your best. So we have put together some useful hints and tips about how to do well from the initial application form all the way through to our assessment centres. You’ll find it all on our <span>advice</span> page.</p>
<p>We believe our programmes are focused on students at different points in their academic life and so are not expecting applicants to apply for more than one programme. To that end, your first application will be accepted and any duplicates will be rejected.</p>
<p>If you have a situation that you believe you would like to be considered for more than one programme in any given year, please email <a href="mailto:BankofEngland@penna.com">BankofEngland@penna.com</a> for further discussion about your circumstances.</p>
