<h2>PhD Research Programme</h2>
<p>As part of our strengthened commitment to research, we have introduced a Research Programme for new PhD entrants.  This programme is designed to offer significant scope to conduct policy-relevant research and opportunities to develop research skills further.  A fixed salary package of £57,000 will be offered for the three year duration of the programme, plus competitive benefits and pension. </p>
<p>While on the programme, you will spend at least 50% of your time doing research.  You will also get involved in policy work in your area.  Successful candidates will be expected to publish in top-quality journals and collaborate with external and visiting academics.</p>
<p class="p1">At the end of the three-year programme, PhD researchers continue their careers at the Bank in either a research or policy role, depending on their personal preferences and interests. There are many interesting opportunities, including roles that involve a combination of research and policy work, as well as research management.</p>
<p>We are looking for highly trained researchers across all areas of economics, finance, and related disciplines with the capacity for innovative, world-class research and a fascination for the policy issues.  We are also keen to make a reality of cross-disciplinary approaches to policy problems and would welcome applications from disciplines other than economics and finance, if you have the technical skills that can be applied to our research projects and have the enthusiasm to do so.</p>
